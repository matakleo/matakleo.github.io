                        Impacts of Momentum Roughness Length on Hurricane Development

                        The momentum roughness length (z0) significantly impacts wind predictions 
                        in weather and climate models. Nevertheless, the impacts of z0 parameterizations
                         in different wind regimes and various model configurations on the hurricane size,
                          intensity, and track simulations have not been thoroughly established.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To bridge this knowledge gap, a comprehensive analysis of 310 
                        simulations of 10 real hurricanes using the Weather Research 
                        and Forecasting (WRF) model is conducted in comparison with observations. 
                        Our results show that the default z0 parameterizations in WRF perform well 
                        for weak (category 1-2) hurricanes; however, they underestimate the intensities 
                        of strong (category 3-5) hurricanes. This finding is independent of model 
                        resolution or boundary layer schemes.

                        The default values of z0 in WRF agree with the observational estimates
                         from dropsonde data in weak hurricanes while they are much larger than 
                         observations in strong hurricanes regime. Decreasing z0 close to the
                          values of observational estimates and theoretical hurricane intensity
                           models in high wind regimes (≳ 45 m s-1) led to significant improvements
                            in the intensity forecasts of strong hurricanes. A momentum budget analysis
                             dynamically explained why the reduction of z0 (decreased surface turbulent s
                             tresses) leads to stronger simulated storms.
